# Location Profile

**Price Range:** 8-15 JOD per night (11-21 USD)

### History
Built in the 1950s as residential apartments. Converted to hostel in 2012 when the building's lack of modern amenities made it uncompetitive as housing. Cheap renovation: paint, bunks, wifi. Never upgraded to include air conditioning because "it's not that hot most of the year" and "backpackers don't expect luxury."

```

### The Death Location (Specific)
Central courtyard, approximately 8x8 meters. Open to sky, surrounded by white-painted walls that reflect and concentrate heat. Concrete floor absorbs and radiates heat. Single ceiling fan circulates hot air. Plastic chairs arranged around tables. A few dead potted plants. Temperature in courtyard during heat wave: approximately 5°C hotter than ambient due to reflected heat and poor ventilation.

## The City

**City:** Amman
**Country:** Jordan
**Population:** ~4 million
**Known for:** Ancient citadel, Roman theater, gateway to Petra and Wadi Rum, modernizing Middle Eastern city, extreme summer heat

## The Staff

### Reception
**Name:** Mahmoud "Mo" Azar
**Description:** 35, friendly, overworked, doing his best with limited resources. Local guy who fell into hospitality. Genuinely cares about guests but can't force them to take care of themselves.
**Role in death:** Warning-giver (ignored). Offered Kris ice water multiple times. Suggested air-conditioned cafe nearby. Watched helplessly as Kris refused everything.

### Other Staff
| Role | Name | Notable Trait |
|------|------|---------------|
| Cleaner | Fatima | Comes in mornings only; during heat wave, won't stay past 10 AM |
| Night Shift | Hassan | Mo's cousin, works evenings, wasn't present during crisis |
| Owner | Tariq Haddad | Lives in Gulf, sends money but won't invest in AC ("too expensive") |

### Staff Knowledge
Mo knows the courtyard is a death trap in this heat—he's been begging the owner for years to install shade structures or AC. He's seen heat exhaustion before but never this bad. He did everything he could short of physically forcing Kris to cool down.

## Hostel Atmosphere

### Day Vibe
During heat wave: abandoned. Most guests have fled to AC cafes, swimming pools, or cooler regions. Those who remain move slowly, sleep through afternoons, speak in low voices. The hostel feels post-apocalyptic.

### Night Vibe
Slightly more active as temperatures drop to merely 35°C. Guests emerge, eat, compare survival strategies. Rooftop would be nice except there isn't one. Everyone talks about the heat.

### Guest Demographics
Budget backpackers, adventure travelers en route to Petra, occasional runner types (like Kris). During heat wave: skeleton crew of those who can't afford to change plans and those who think they're tough enough. Average stay: 2-3 nights.

### Reputation
Reviews: "Basic but friendly" / "Mo is great" / "No AC - brutal in summer" / "Good location for the price" / "Avoid July-August unless you enjoy suffering."

## Practical Details

### Getting There
From Queen Alia International Airport: bus or taxi to downtown (45 min). Hostel is on a side street off Rainbow Street, near the Roman amphitheater. Walking distance to major sites (if you can walk in the heat).

### Check-in Process
Mo checks passport, collects payment, gives keys and brief orientation. Points out kitchen, bathroom, wifi password. In summer: also points out nearest air-conditioned refuges.

### Rules
1. Quiet hours: 23:00-07:00
2. No smoking inside
3. Kitchen closes at 22:00
4. During heat waves: PLEASE drink water (sign posted)
5. Hostel not responsible for heat-related illness

## Real-World Research

### Accuracy Notes
- Amman's downtown hostel scene is accurately depicted
- Heat waves in Jordan have reached record temperatures in recent years
- Traditional architecture works better with traditional behavior (midday rest)
- Budget hostels often lack AC due to cost of installation and electricity
- Heat-related deaths among tourists do occur in the region

### Cultural Sensitivity
- Jordanian hospitality is genuine; Mo is doing his best
- The danger is environmental and individual, not cultural
- Locals understand the heat and behave accordingly
- The victim's death is his own fault, not Jordan's

### Sources
- Amman tourism information
- Jordan weather data and heat wave records
- WHO heat-illness protocols
- Reviews of actual Amman hostels
